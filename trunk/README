SCELib Readme

Simple C Extension Library (scelib) provides usual C programming tasks, such as
string management, command line parsing and so on. The goal of this library is
not to replace big ones like glib, but to provide a quick way to create simple
programs.

Its most important aspects are :
- Free software, under the GNU Lesser Public License (see the COPYING file)
- Easy to compile, on any platform, with the minimal compilation tool set, and
  without those autoconf/automake tools which are great for complicated
  projects, but to tricky for little ones, like scelib.
- Slim, so it can be linked in a static way to programs. Making a shared
  library is possible too, but for those who just want a simple API as part of
  their language environment, the static archive is a good thing.
- Slim, but in its code too. Using scelib is just like using functions from the
  C standard library, but without their restrictions :-). You've a minimal set
  of API, easily identifiable.
- Portable on any platform, not only unices or only Windows. SCELib only uses
  C standard library fucntions, and when thoses are known not to be right
  implemented or not implemented at all on some platforms, SCELib gives its
  version, which is often easier to use (but may have performance penalties).

For build/installation instructions, see the INSTALL file in the same directory
that this README.
