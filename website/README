The website is genetaed from xml source files, which are processed by
xsltproc (from libxslt) to generate the final html files.

How this's organized ?

I put in the subversion repository the source files, composed of:
* the xml files, containing datas, and stored in the src directory
* the xsl files, containing the rules to process the transformation,
  and stored in the proc directory
* all other files, needed for the web site, like css and image files,
  and contained in the res directory.
* the Makefile, which can be called to generate the output.
* the htdocs directory will contain the make result : the web site
