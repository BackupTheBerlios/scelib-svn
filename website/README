The website is genetaed from xml source files, which are processed by
xsltproc (from libxslt) to generate the final html files.

How this's organized ?

I put in the subversion repository the source files, composed of:
* the xml files, containing datas, and stored in the src directory
* the xsl files, containing the rules to process the transformation,
  and stored in the trans directory
* all other files, needed for the web site, like css and image files,
  and contained in the res directory.
* the Makefiles, in each directory, which can be called to generate the
  output.
* the htdocs directory will contain the make result : the web site

The make command will be used to :
* update the current tree from svn
* generate files which are added or updated (if the xsl files are modified,
  of course, all is regenerated)
* install the generated files to output destination
* of course, clean the generated tree
* why not, pack the sources ?
