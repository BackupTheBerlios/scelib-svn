the website generator TODO list :-)

* create an xml schema or dtd for the input xml files, so they can be validated
  during transformation. Thoses should be in the trans directory, along with
  xsl files.

* all :-) :
  - the datas (xml)
  - the css
  - add images if needed
  - split the main xsl file into small ones

* xml files to do (according to the menu.xml) :
  - index.*.xml (basic)
  - features.*.xml (complete the table)
  - prj.*.xml (to fill entirely)
