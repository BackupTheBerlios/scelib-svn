the website generator TODO list :-)

* create an xml schema or dtd for the input xml files, so they can be validated
  during transformation. Thoses should be in the trans directory, along with
  xsl files.

* all :-) :
  - the datas (xml)
  - the css
  - add images if needed
  - complete the main xsl file

* xml files to do (according to the menu.xml) :
  - index.*.xml (in progress)
  - about.*.xml
  - news.*.xml (this should be dynamic, from another xml file maybe)
  - legal.*.xml (in progress)
  - prj.*.xml
